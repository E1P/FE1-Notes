# DOM 101

## Presuppositions

All preknowledge is from pre-course section 3

- creating basic html elements e.g. p tags, lists (ul, li)
- adding attributes to html elements (classes, ids)
- basic css

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the nested structure of the DOM
- Be able to use DOM functions to select, create, update & delete html elements
- Be able to manipulate & create HTML elements
- Understand what an event is, and identify different types of events
- Understand what an event listener / handler is and its role in making an HTML page interactive
- Be able to use event listeners and handlers

## What is the DOM?

From MDN:

> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page...
> The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

- Open browser and visit a website. Use developer tools to inspect the HTML.

```js
document.getElementById(/*"someId"*/);
```

This is Javascript interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model) and its properties / methods, rather than Javascript itself. Other languages can do this. You can maybe think of this as working in an environment with some global variables & these variables have lots of methods on them.

## Hyper Text Markup Language

- Create an HTML file
- Use the `!â‡¥` shortcut
- Talk through the different aspects of the file:

1.  `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser what type of markup language (XML possible too) to expect & therefore how to parse it. In HTML5 there is only one kind of doctype declaration, but in the past there were others. HTML4 had 3 ways to do this. (mention browser wars & ask what browsers students use) - [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)
2.  All of it is wrapped in `<HTML>` tags (lang code assists search engines)
3.  `head` contains meta information. This contains machine parsable information (for SEO, how browser should display content on load)

4.  The body is the part that is actually shown on the page [add some things to the body]

```html
<h1>My Example Page</h1>
<p id="test">
  Hello! This is my example page. Here is a
  <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">good DOM reference</a>.
</p>
```

5.  It is common to use javascript added in script tags.
    Anything acting on the DOM is included at the bottom of the `<body>`. This is so that all of the dom nodes have loaded before the script tag is run. You can also add JS inline but ew.

    - A more modern approach is to put js in an external file and link to it. Can use defer to ensure elements have loaded before script is run.

6.  Add a `<script>` tag to the bottom of the body

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.log("And here is the console!");
</script>
```

7.  Show console command `open index.html` - point out that it only updates when you refresh

8.  Show Live Server extension for VS Code

## How the browser works

- The browser makes an HTTP request to our server.

- The server will respond with the HTTP response, incuding an HTML body (hopefully).

- The browser passes the HTML body to its engine. In Safari/Chrome this is Webkit. (Firefox uses Gecko and IE uses Trident.)

- The engine will parse the HTML, and start building the elements one by one. If in that order, it first parses the head, then body, then script tag (passed to the browser's JS engine).

  - Chrome / Node.js - V8
  - Firefox / Netscape Navigator - Spidermonkey / Rhino
  - Safari - Javascript Core (AKA Nitro?)

- Once the JS engine finishes a process called 'tokenising', which is sort of like parsing, it can run the code.

**--- EXAMPLE 1 ---**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      alert("hello World!");
    </script>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="hi">Hello there, lovely</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## The DOM as a Tree

The DOM is a tree structure. Our tree starts with a root node, which is `document.documentElement` - or the HTML tag that we start building with.

**--- DIAGRAM (DOM TREE) ---**

Then it has children. The DOM provides methods to all you to traverse an element's children with some kind of loop, or you can go to the very first child or the very last child with commands like:

```js
document.documentElement.firstElementChild;
document.documentElement.lastElementChild;
```

You can also refer to nodes by their siblings, for example:

```js
document.body.previousElementSibling;
document.body.nextElementSibling;
```

## Fetching Elements

We can see this whole structure in the elements tab of our inspector. We could also console log out the document and hone in on a certain thing with commands like:

```js
document.getElementById("hi");
```

- (console.log vs console.dir)

Because the DOM is built as a tree, navigating it is inefficient. The implementations of how this navigation differ between browsers, but we know it has to use recursion under the hood, otherwise it can't possibly see deeply nested elements. This is one example:

**--- EXAMPLE 2 ---**

```js
let pTags = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
```

Methods like this (that `getElements...`) do not return an array, but an `HTMLcollection`. As an array like object, when can index it, but not use array methods. To do this, it needs to be spread into a new array:

```js
const pTags = [...document.getElementsByTagName("p")];
const pTagStr = pTags.reduce((str, p) => `${str} ${p.innerText}`, "");
```

same with getting by class names...

## Manipulating the DOM

We can manipulate the html that has been returned to the browser in the console:

---BROWSER EXAMPLE---

```js
const imgsByTag = [...document.getElementsByTagName("img")];
imgsByTag.forEach(img => (img.src = "http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/011/365/GRUMPYCAT.jpg"));
```

Another way we could have found all the images is with a query selector. `document.querySelector` will return an HTML element, `document.querySelectorAll` returns a `NodeList`. NodeLists are similar to HTML collections in that they are array-like objects, but they have more ways of enumerating - they have a .forEach method attached, as well as keys, values and entries.

```js
const imgsByQuery = document.querySelectorAll("img");
imgsByQuery.forEach(img => (img.src = "http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/011/365/GRUMPYCAT.jpg"));
```

HTML collections are considered a bit of an 'artifact' as NodeLists are more powerful, but both are used and different browsers may return different things.

We can add functions to nodes by attaching them to the event handlers hooks provided. This is a simple way to attach functionality.

**--- EXAMPLE 3: emoji page ---**

```js
const emoji = document.getElementById("smiley");
emoji.onclick = getMoreAngry;
function getLessAngry() {
  emoji.innerText = "ðŸ˜ ";
  emoji.onclick = getMoreAngry;
}

function getMoreAngry() {
  emoji.innerText = "ðŸ˜¡";
  emoji.onclick = getLessAngry;
}
```

Another way to attach listeners is with `.addEventListener` - it's important to do this if there's a risk of you overwriting events you don't want to.

```js
emoji.addEventListener("click", getMoreAngry);
```

Adding or replacing nodes can be trickier. Nodes have a number of methods available which we can use to change the structure of the document, but these all work around the relationships in the DOM tree.

We may also want to create new nodes. (In the lecture here we created - and removed new p tag nodes ).

```js
function createAngryText() {
  const newPTag = document.createElement('p');
  newPTag.innerText = 'Im really angry now!!';
  newPTag.setAttribute('id', 'angryText');
  body.appendChild(newPTag);
}

function toggleAnger() {
  const angryText = document.querySelector('#angryText');
  if (smiley.innerText === 'ðŸ˜ ') {
    smiley.innerText = 'ðŸ˜¡';
    if (!angryText) return createAngryText();
```

I want the number of rabbits on my page to double every time I click on any of them. This will quickly get out of control as we have insane bunny growth, but let's try and reason it out.

Ensure that you create a new node for each iteration in your loop - a node can only be in one place.

```js
function multiply() {
  const farm = document.getElementById("farm");
  const rabbits = [...document.getElementsByTagName("img")];
  rabbits.forEach(rabbit => {
    const rabbitNode = document.createElement("img");
    rabbitNode.src = "new image source";
    rabbitNode.addEventListener("click", multiply);
    farm.appendChild(rabbitNode);
  });
}
```

In this version, we have recreated all the attributes on the new element with .src and .addEventListener. A neater way to do this would be with .cloneElement:

```js
const newRabbit = rabbit.cloneNode();
```

(Note .cloneNode takes a 'deep' argument if you want to clone all child nodes too!)
