# Testing React Apps

- Provide an overview of the different tools available to test React.
- Reinforce the ways that Cypress can be used to test any browser-based front-end application.
- Demonstrate stubbing api requests with cypress.
- Show embedded routers if time.

## Unit Testing with React

`create-react-app` comes with a few scripts in the `package.json`. One of these is `test`. This uses `Jest`, which you have used in your BE2 and FE katas, to run any files that match the filename conventions. We can find more information about testing on the lovely `create-react-app` [website](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

## Use Jest with TDD to create any util functions

The first thing we can do to make sure our code is robust, is to extract as much logic from our components as possible.

Here's an extremely contrived example: Say we had a function that added two numbers in order to update state.
Maybe based on what was in state and something that a user inputs. We can create a pure function, using TDD, to do this.

```jsx
// in the component
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { sum } from "../utils/index.js";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    number: 0
  };
  render() {
    // some JSX
  }
  handleUserInteraction = number => {
    const updatedNumber = sum(number, this.state.number);
    this.setState({
      number: updatedNumber
    });
  };
}
```

Then we can extract out the function:

```js
// in ./src/utils/index.js
export const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

And test it:

```js
// in ./src/__tests__/*.test.js
import { sum } from "../utils/index.js";

test("sums two numbers", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
// ...etc
```

## Stubbing API Requests

Let's start with what we had from yesterday.
We can see that there is a lot of test data in the database already.
Imagine if we ran tests using production API. **What problems could arise because of this?**

1. Would mess up our production db
2. Tests will be flakey - data will be inconsistent & subject to server or connections problems
3. Gives us less control over responses (How would you test for a 500, crash the server?)

We could set up a separate test database to deal with this but it's going to be a pain. **Problems?**

1. We'd have to change our code (even if it is just the `BASE_URL`)
2. We'd have to run a local version of our API.
3. These tests will be slower (not significantly at first, but by the time we have loads of tests running for a large scale app, it will have an impact)

It's not quite as clear cut as that. Everything is a tradeoff. More benefits / negatives to these different approaches can be found [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests.html#Testing-Strategies)

So, what's the solution? Stub the api requests.
There are a few options for doing this:

- [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) is really good for stubbing XML HTTP Requests (XHR). It works with any tests that are run by node.
- [Fetch Mock](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/) is good for stubbing requests made by the fetch API. Most don't do both.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/manual-mocks) - set up our own mocks with Jest.
- [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests.html#Testing-Strategies) has this functionality built in. Only works in the browser though, so it can't be used for React Native etc. Also does't work for the fetch API.

## Set up Cypress

- `npm i -D cypress`
- add script to `package.json`: `"cy:open": "cypress open"`
- add `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000"` to `cypress.json`

### Create a Test

Use the [cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html) for reference.
Test the `/students` route. In `./cypress/integration/students.spec.js`:

```js
describe("/students", () => {
  it("displays all students", () => {
    // create a "server"
    cy.server();
    // set up which request url you would like to intecept
    // 2nd argument is the response you want to give
    // it is important that this matches the data structure of the real API
    cy.route("*/students", {
      students: [
        {
          _id: 1,
          name: "Mitch",
          startingCohort: 1,
          blockHistory: [1, 2]
        },
        {
          _id: 2,
          name: "Paul",
          startingCohort: 2,
          blockHistory: [1]
        }
      ]
    });
    cy.visit("/students");
    cy.get("li").should("have.length", 2);
  });
});
```

### Refactor Test

Now, we can refactor the test.

`./cypress/fixtures/students.json`:

```json
{
  "students": [
    {
      "_id": 1,
      "name": "Mitch",
      "startingCohort": 1,
      "blockHistory": [1, 2]
    },
    {
      "_id": 2,
      "name": "Paul",
      "startingCohort": 2,
      "blockHistory": [1]
    }
  ]
}
```

In `./cypress/support/commands.js`:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add("stubAndVisit", (path = "") => {
  cy.server();
  cy.route("*/students", "fx:students.json");
  cy.visit(path);
});
```

...and the test again:

```js
describe("/students", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.stubAndVisit("/students");
  });
  it("displays all students", () => {
    cy.get("li").should("have.length", 2);
  });
});
```

Next, let's add a test for the StudentAdder:

We need to stub the post request first. Let's make our custom command accept a student argument, so that we can use that in our assertions later:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add("stubAndVisit", (path = "", studentToAdd) => {
  cy.server();
  cy.route("*/students", "fx:students.json");
  cy.route("POST", "*/students", {
    ...studentToAdd,
    _id: 3,
    blockHistory: [1]
  });
  cy.visit(path);
});
```

Let's keep our student to post higher in scope so we can use both it in the `beforeEach` and `it` blocks.
Then, we can simulate typing in the details and adding a button.
Finally, we should add an assertion.

```js
describe("/students", () => {
  const student = { name: "Alex", startingCohort: 2 };
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.stubAndVisit("/students", student);
  });
  it("displays all students", () => {
    cy.get("li").should("have.length", 2);
  });
  it("can add a student to the list", () => {
    cy.get("#name").type(student.name);
    cy.get("#startingCohort").type(student.startingCohort);
    cy.get("form button").click();

    cy.get("main").contains(student.name);
  });
});
```

## Embedded Routers

- Instead of the pattern we have seen so far, where we add a component on a sub-route using composition, we can use [_embedded routers_](https://reach.tech/router/example/embedded-routers)

```jsx
// in App.js render
<Router>
  <Home path="/" />
  {/* make sure to use /* so child routes
          have a chance to match */}
  <Blocks path="blocks/*" />
</Router>

// in Blocks.js render
<Router>
  <Block path=":block_id" />
</Router>
```
