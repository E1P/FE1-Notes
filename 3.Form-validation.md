# FORM VALIDATION

The _action_ part of a form denotes an endpoint to which data is sent (like an API). You can assign 'GET' or 'POST' as a _method_ - as you know, there is not much difference apart from semantically, although POST requests don't display the URL so should be used for sensitive data.

The controls in an html form come in a variety you have got to know over the years - text input, radio buttons, checkboxes. They have developed to accept _types_ which are implemented by browsers. A 'hidden' attribute was one way data was persisted around forms without displaying it unnecessarily; http shound have no state (RESTFUL principle!) so this was one way round that.

Full list [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type.asp)

Labels are a semantic html element that doesn't render as anything special but adds usability by allowing the user to click on the label to select the input. The for attribute of the label should be equal to the id atrribute of the input.

Another example of _free_ functionality provided by the correct semantic element. :)

Each input of our form has a relevent label, linked by the inputs id and the labels for attribute.

Our button has a type of submit, when you click the button, or press enter in a text input the 'submit' event is triggered and the form completes it action.

The forms default action is to make a POST request to the action attribute. It will take the values from the inputs and send them as a query string, e.g. ?username=paul&password=password1 etc...

## Fetch

Now we can take control of the way we send information with JavaScript. You may see XMLHttpRequest dotted around - used to be the main way, used by Ajax, but I am going to show you the fetch API, a perhaps neater solution available in all modern browsers (note this is a browser implementation, fetch is not available in Node).

When we submit our form we can see the console log flash up and then dissappear. This is the POST request taking us to a new page. We want to stop that happening and take control of the request so we use the events preventDefault method.

```js
form.addEventListener("submit", event => {
  event.preventDefault();
  logIn();
});

function logIn() {}
```

Writing functional, maintainable javascript will help you seperate you concerns and stop your functions from becoming large and unwieldly.

To make our post request we will now need the values from the inputs, so let's go get them using a _css selector_ (getElementById also works but the css selector is what cypress uses so good to practice).

```js
const usernameInput = document.querySelector('form input[id=username]');
const passwordInput = document.querySelector('form input[id=password]');

form.addEventListener('submit', event => {
    const username = usernameInput.value;
    const password = passwordInput.value;
    logIn(username, password);
}
```

Now we can handle the logIn functionality entirely on it's own. MDN provides a reference for the [Fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) as well as a [guide to using fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

We provide a url and fetch will make a GET request by default. Note the response body is a readable stream and must be converted to json using the asyncronous response.json() method.
The mdn website has a good example of a post request body options

```js
function logIn(username, password) {
  fetch("https://legionsofcats.herokuapp.com/api/cats", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      username,
      password
    })
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(body => {
      console.log(body);
    });
}
```

## Validation

We know that we must provide a username and password for our fetch to work. If the user has not completed the fields then there is no point making the api call. When you try and sign in without providing information websites will often prompt you to complete the fields before trying to submit. This is front-end validation.

A nice [guide](https://mono.company/design-practice/the-10-commandments-of-good-form-design-on-the-web/) on form design can be found here.

We can provide feedback to the user inline as they are going along. Think about when you are signing up to a website.

### Confirmations

First thing, we need to know when the user has completed a field. We can use an event listener to trigger this. A list of events can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)

We need one when the user has typed into the box. Change is desinged for this. (Point out blur for losing focus and input/keydown will work as well but provide feedback halfway through typing).

Let's do username first.

```js
username.addEventListener("change", completed);

function completed(event) {
  const input = event.target;
}
```

To get the element clicked on we can use the event.target. Console.dir the input to see the properties of the input and note the classList. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) shows us the classList methods for adding and removing classes.

We can use this to add some css that will mark it as completed. Can just be green for now.

## Local Storage

HTML5 is the latest widely adopted variation of the language browsers use to read information. It comes with some cool new additions, including a few html tags, but also APIs for local storage (no more cookies), media players, canvas & svg, and many others. We'll take a quick look at local storage.

Local storage is beautifully elegant - it just allows you to store KVPs that are bound to the site. Four main exposed methods: set, get and remove item, and clear() to empty everything. They will last when you close the browser (if you want them to disappear, use sessionStorage).

We'll use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) to store our cat img and make it available when we refresh.

There are 4 main methods we are interested in:

- setItem
- getItem
- removeItem
- clear

```js
	const userInput = event.target.value
     // validate input
      localStorage.setItem('username', userInput);
    });
```

## User experience points

Good:

- Confirmation of completed fields when you move on to the next
- Clear prompts of what’s expected (Password restrictions etc...)
- Errors are pointed out before you submit.
- Clear colour schemes, green is good, red is bad. :slightly_smiling_face:
- Progress Bars for long forms.
- Good tabbing, sort-codes are a great example of this.
- Auto-focus

Bad:

- Unclear what the restrictions are.
- Not validating until the whole thing is completed and having to go back to it to correct mistakes.
  -Validating too early. When you’re halfway through typing something.
- Placeholders disappearing when you start typing.
