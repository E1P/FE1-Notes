## React Intro 2 (Quote Generator)

## Prior Knowledge

- Be able to use jsx and know how & when to transition between js & jsx
- Be able to create components (functional & class) and split code into separate components
- Understand concept of state and props and how to update / transfer
- Comfortable with event handlers

## Learning Objectives

- Better planning design and architecture of a react project
- Able to multiple files for react projects
- Minimise state
- Be able to conditionally rendering jsx
- Be able to use react dev tools as a debugging aid

## create-react-app

- React was created by FB (first used in 2011 & then open sourced in 2013)
- Check out [state of js](https://stateofjs.com/).
- create-react-app made by FB as a tool to get started with React projects.
- Run `npx create-react-app quote-gen` && `npm start`
- create-react-app [website](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) .
- Get rid of bumpf. (`registerServiceWorker.js` is to do with offline caching, cool code but no use to us now!)

## Designing the application

### Questions to ask yourself:

- What do you want the application to do?
- What components does it need? What data does it require?
- What functionality is needed?
- What will it look like?

> Take time to _pare down the state_ - there is no need to hold the 'selected quote' separately - we can hold an indication of the **index**, and use render to determine what quote gets passed down.

Check out this [thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) site, it gives some good ideas about planning your projects.

## Dumb / Presentation components

- _Dumb_, or _presentational_, are called so because their only responsibility is to present something to the DOM.
- This compares to _smart_ components which have a different responsibility. They have the burden of being smart, and are the ones that keep track of state and care about how the app works.

- A Quote component only needs to receive and display data not keep track of it

- Build it statically - a hard coded quote - to begin with.

- Pass down the necessary props and get it rendering.

## Functional vs. Class components

| functional                   | classes                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| has `props`                  | has `props`                 |
| no `state`                   | `state`ful                  |
| no methods avaiable          | has methods e.g. `setState` |
| access `props` by parameters | access `props` via `this`   |
| no `render` method           | `render` method             |
| little transpiling needed    | lots of transpilng needed   |
| clear role of component      | not as clear                |

## When to upgrade to a class

1. When you need to store something
2. When you need life-cycle methods (next week's content)

## React Dev Tools

A really useful react aid, [React dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi).

Use this to have more awareness of what is going on in your components, what's in `props` and `state` .

## Build the Button component

- The change quote functionality should live in app because it affects app state. _Fundamental unbreakable rule!_
- It's good practice to write handlers for event listeners you want to utilise. _Why?_ Useful to extract behaviour and have options to do more stuff.
- If you need to do anything with the event, then that should be the responsibility of the handler - the component that sets state should only be setting state. _Do one thing well!_

## Show / Hide the author

1. store in App state when it's time to reveal the author
2. Conditionally render the author in the quote component when showAuthor is true

```jsx
// within Quote render
{
  this.props.showAuthor ? <p>{quote.author}</p> : null;
}
```

- logical `and` operator can achieve the `if` without an `else`

```jsx
// within Quote render
{
  this.props.showAuthor && <p>{quote.author}</p>;
}
```

- NB There other ways to [conditionally render](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html). Use as appropriate.

3. Toggling showAuthor: boolean stored in app therefore functionality has to live there, too. It can be passed it to another Button with this function as a `prop`.

- How could you make the text switch between `reveal author` and `hide author`? conditional props?

```js
// in App render
<Button toggleShowAuthor={this.toggleShowAuthor} text={showAuthor ? "hide author" : "reveal author"} />
```

## Prop-types

[_Prop-types_](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are a way of helping yourself and other developers read your react project and get better error messages, particularly when passing around lots of information on `props`

Now you know React!

## Final notes:

### There's lots of older react code online that you shouldn't be using

1. Don't need constructor method as [shown in docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

```js
// at top of class component
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    stuff: ""
  };
}
```

- Can just use `state = ....`

```js
// at top of class component

state = {
  stuff: ""
};
```

2. No need to bind `this` to functions

```js
// passing function on props
handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
```

- Arrow functions methods do this already
