# CSS

## Pre-knowledge

- A lot of this material should have been explored in PRE-Section 3, including a basic understanding of CSS syntax and how to apply it using selectors in your HTML.

## Takeaways

- ways to approach display and layout in CSS
- debugging CSS in the browser
- using flex and grid / being aware of parent & child relationships
- basic CSS animation syntax
- CSS in React
- some other CSS tools and behaviours

## Background

CSS was first proposed as a solution to separating the presentation of a document from its content (the realm of HTML) in 1994, a year before JavaScript. It has undergone several changes since then, including several key features falling under the `CSS3` umbrella, including flex and grid.

Everything covered in these notes is widely supported in browsers, though you do need to be aware of some issues using flex and grid in Safari and older browsers.

Several tools exist around CSS which we do not cover in the course, including pre-processors such as `SASS`, `LESS` and `Stylus` which allow you to write CSS with other syntaxes, allowing better code organisation and reusability.

## Notes

### Default styling

We previously constructed our data visualisation webpage with no styling except what was applied by default to the tags we used in our JSX. Today we will think of some ways we can organise the presentation of our code, which is the responsibility of our CSS.

Placement of elements on screen is defined by the **box model** of CSS, where each element's `content` takes up a certain space. This can be affected by `padding`, `borders` and `margin`. This [MDN intro documentation / tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model) does a good job of explaining the basics and includes a set of exploratory exercises, which could help remove some of the perceived unpredictability of approaching layout with CSS.

One significant impact on how elements are rendered is their `display` property. Many commonly used HTML tags come with defaults - all the default CSS behaviours of tags can be found listed at this [W3Schools - CSS default values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp) page.

We can see this in action by inspecting an element using the browser's development tools. The `ul` tag, for example, is blocking (set to `display: block`), forcing our chart to render underneath.

You can override default behaviours of HTML tags simply by specifying values in your CSS. This will remove the default bullet points and left margin, applying a consistent margin to all sides.

```css
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0.2em;
}
```

### Flexbox and Grid

`Flexbox` and `grid` are alternative display modes that exist as other ways you can force elements to take up specific areas on screen. They are pre-existed by some other approaches to this, including `tables` (which are similar to Grid in some ways, but are not semantically appropriate and are more limited) and `multi-column` layout, which can be used to achieve a newspaper or Pinterest style layout, but is not widely adopted otherwsie.

Both `flexbox` and `grid` rely on parent-child relationships between elements. Failing to track this is a common source of unexpected behaviour, and this can be hard to do in React when parent and child elements can exist in different components and different files. Using a sensible naming system that helps you tie together these elements is a good idea.

It's possible that in your React application, you'll find a parent in one component and multiple children returned in a second component. You can't return multiple children (JSX needs to be returned with one parent element) so the solution could be a `React.Fragment` ([docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)), which allows you to enclose the elements, but when the DOM is constructed, will disappear, so the parent-child relationship is maintained.

There are different opinions on how `flexbox` and `grid` should be used. One approach is to make `flexbox` responsible for the **one-directional** flow of elements, and grid for the **two-directional** organisation. They can - and probably should - be used together on a page to achieve appropriate effect.

#### Flex

For our app, `flexbox` is a good solution for displaying our books. By setting `display: flex;`, there is a lot of responsiveness built in, and we can also set some other properties that we will have access to, for example:

- we can set the `wrap` property to make child elements flow on to the next line
- we can use `justify-content: center` as a simple way to position our books centrally on the axis of the flex parent (by default, the y-axis)

```css
.books {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  list-style-type: none;
  overflow: scroll;
  margin: 0.2em;
  padding: 0.2em;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

We haven't needed to set any properties on any child elements here, but child elements are having styling applied by virtue of being placed within a parent `display: flex` element. There are child properties that can be applied, such as forcing the element to take up an increased share of the parent container.

#### Grid

`Grid` is a good solution for our page arrangement, which we want to keep enclosed within the viewport of the browser. This can be achieved by styling a parent element with `display: grid;`. Like `flexbox`, this opens up ways to configure the layout in the parent element. This example demonstrates how to confine our desired layout on screen, applied to the `App` component (our top-level component, after the `body`).

```css
.app {
  display: grid;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 95vh;
  grid-template: 6em 1fr 6em / 1fr 30em 1fr;
}
```

To achieve this in this example, we had to:

- overwrite the default blocking behaviour of a `div` display to be a `grid`.
- set the width and height to be responsive to the width and height of the viewport using the `vw` and `vh` units (**viewport width** and **viewport height**).
- apply a grid-template. This is a shorthand for row sizes and column sizes, split with the `/` (they can be expressed separately or individually with `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`). We have set absolute values for the top and bottom rows, and central column, with `em`. The `fr` unit exists in grids and tells and element to take up a remaining 'fraction' of the available space.

`Grid` children will attempt to find their slot within the grid system, but this will often not happen by default, and in any case, it's a good idea to be explicit in your decalarations anyway. Here are the child declarations for our two bookshelves.

Note that we have to separate these from our `.books` class because they need to take up different spaces. But we can still leave the shared behaviour in `.books` and apply multiple classes to avoid repitition in our code.

```css
.books-all {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 4 / 2;
}

.books-selected {
  grid-area: 1 / 3 / 4 / 4;
}
```

These grid area properties are shorthand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end` and `grid-column-end` and denote the grid areas that we want our elements to take up. The start declarations are inclusive and end declarations are exclusive.

##### Named grid areas

Handling grid areas numerically can be awkward. Grid also provides a facility for naming areas, which can be much easier to code and debug. Adding this to our page might look something like this:

```css
.app {
  display: grid;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 95vh;
  grid-template: 6em 1fr 6em / 1fr 30em 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    "books-all header   books-selected"
    "books-all datavis  books-selected"
    "books-all controls books-selected";
}
```

Already we can see much more clearly what we were trying to achieve with our grid. Instead of numerically defining the rows and columns in our children, we can use the name instead. Note how the name is not expressed as a string (no quotes), this is because these are CSS variables that are being referenced.

```css
.books-all {
  grid-area: books-all;
}
```

### CSS animations

CSS animations are a lightweight solution to adding some dynamism into your projects, without resulting to third-party plugins which can be bulky. It avoids the need to branch into `canvas` or `svg` elements too - you can animate many (but by no means all) basic CSS properties.

There are several animation-related CSS properties, but it is commen to see the essential ones expressed in a one-line `animation` property:

```css
.book {
  animation: appear 1s linear;
}
```

- The first property is the name we will use for animation definition.
- The second is the duration, here expressed in seconds.
- The third is shape of the transition. The default is linear, so that the animated properties change in direct proportion to the time that has elapsed since the animation started. There are other preset defaults (such as `ease-in`), or you can use a custom `timing function` which applies a cubic bezier to the progression. [More on this can be found on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/timing-function).

To define the behaviour of the animation, use `@keyframes` in your css, followed by the name you attributed in your animation property. There are several ways of defining and combining animation steps, but the simplest is to define `from` and `to` objects that describe the start and end points of your animation:

```css
@keyframes appear {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.3) rotate(60deg);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg);
  }
}
```

We can also see here the use of `transform` which is an animatable property designed influence the shape and/or placement of an element (and should be used instead of `position` properties such as `top` and `left`, which are not animatable).
