# React Lifecycle 1

## Introducing the Lifecycle

Let's take a look at state. We know that state in our Todo App represents the tasks we have to complete. So far, that has been fairly simple, but let's say we have an app that accepts multiple users. Here are some options about how we could structure our data (we're presuming a todo is a string - it's likely we would want to extend this at some point!)

```js
// 1)
state = {
  users: [
    {
      user: "Jonny",
      todos: ["Eat nachos", "Drink sarsaparilla", "Listen to Despacito"]
    },
    {
      user: "Jac",
      todos: ["Eat pizza", "Drink muscato", "Listen to Pavarotti"]
    },
    {
      user: "JD",
      todos: ["Eat bratwurst", "Drink pilsner", "Listen to Rammstein"]
    }
  ]
};
// 2)
state = {
  users: {
    Jonny: ["Eat nachos", "Drink sarsaparilla", "Listen to Despacito"],
    Jac: ["Eat pizza", "Drink muscato", "Listen to Pavarotti"],
    JD: ["Eat bratwurst", "Drink pilsner", "Listen to Rammstein"]
  }
};
// 3)
state = {
  todos: [
    {
      todo: "Eat nachos",
      user: "Jonny"
    },
    {
      todo: "Drink sarsaparilla",
      user: "Jonny"
    },
    {
      todo: "Listen to Pavarotti",
      user: "Jac"
    },
    {
      todo: "Drink pilsner",
      user: "JS"
    }
    // etc.
  ]
};
```

All are possibilities, but which is the best? some things we have to consider: which is the easiest to understand / read? Which is the easiest to interpret in our rendering? Which is the easiest to make alterations to by setting state? And which allows us to make changes to how we structure our data if we choose to do that?

Examples one and two are largely the same; the data is structured around users. Users are unique, so we have the second option where we have a unique key of the person's name. This makes initialising / adapting the state very simple and easy to access the todos via a key. It's also easy to read for coder and non-coder alike.

However the first option offers us more flexibility - a user can easily take on more properties without invalidating the logic that would have been used on the previous version. It's only a little harder to identify the state we want (a `.find` rather than by key). But the nesting is deeper, which makes keeping thing unmutated a bit of a pain when manipulating the data.

The third option is different in that it is structured around the individuality of the todo. It's a more awkward representation in code of the data you have as it's harder to see groups, but perhaps this does not really matter. Arguably, it does not make sense for this data to be held in an array, because it has no 'order' per se. But there are no obvious unique keys to use to store this as an object, and if we were to bring in the idea of order, say how old/new a task way, then this suddenly becomes a very apt way of storing the data, even though it bear little resemblance to what we would see on screen.

## Users

Whichever state we choose, it's possible to draw out a list of unique users without repeating data, which is important. How can we make use of this? Consider:

```js
<div>
  {users.map(profile => {
    return <button onClick={() => this.selectUser(user)}>{user}</button>;
  })}
</div>
```

This creates a button to select the `currentUser` for every potential user - clearly something else we would have to hold on state. This is a neat method because it allows for the creation / removal of users to be accommodated without having to adapt your code. You should set up your state so you can do this without having to make edits, e.g. without holding additional state that repeats this information.

This is logic that belongs in the `render` section of the lifecycle. This is because it is information that can easily be calculated on the fly, and you want to be adaptable. In render, with sensible state, we can employ lightweight code to extract tasks and users and not worry about destroying or manipulating or repeating our state to make it work.

## The Lifecycle

But not everything can happen on render. Let's say we want to save our data so when the application is re-opened we have persisted the tasks set. We know we can use local storage for this. For now, let's create a button that does this:

```js
function TodoSaver({ saveData }) {
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Preserve My Legacy</button>;

  handleClick = event => {
    saveData();
  };

  saveData = () => {
    localStorage.setItem("data", JSON.stringify(this.state));
  };
}
```

All very well and good, but what happens at the other end when we load our application. How are we going to extract the state we want from local storage? Given what we have learnt so far, the only mechanism for doing this is in render, as this is the only part of React's logic we have accessed. Luckily, we have other 'hooks' on which we can attach necessary logic. These are called React's 'lifecycle'.

(Show internet diagram)

The correct lifecycle method to use in this case is `componentDidMount`. This is for logic we want to employ just once on loading the application. So we can employ this in our App class:

```js
componentDidMount = () => {
  const data = localStorage.getItem("data");
  if (data) {
    const state = JSON.parse(data);
    this.setState(state);
  }
};
```

Console logging in render and cDM will show that first render is called, then cDM, then render. This may feel like unnecessary iterations, but it is how React is designed to work. Firstly, we checkt hat the component can mount properly (via render). If it can, then the component 'did' mount, and we can start triggering the cDM behaviour. The cDM's behaviour is then to set state, which triggers a new render, with our updated state. Neat.

## Updating

Having a button achieve the state isn't optimal - what if the browser crashes or is accidentally closed. Would it not be better to be updating our local storage every time there was a change? We could achieve this by calling our saveData function as a callback to our setState methods, e.g.

```js
addTodo = todoToAdd => {
  this.setState(
    state => {
      return {
        profiles: state.profiles.map(profile => {
          if (profile.user === state.currentUser) {
            return {
              ...profile,
              todos: [...profile.todos, todoToAdd]
            };
          }
          return profile;
        })
      };
    },
    () => {
      this.saveData();
    }
  );
};
```

This is safe, because it guarantees the state has updated before saving. But it isn't great. We have to remember to pass this in as an extra argument every time we write a method that sets state.

Handily, React has a lifecycle method that is called whenever state is updated - `componentDidUpdate`. Call our saveData function there, and we never need to worry about tacking it on the end of class methods.

```js
componentDidUpdate = () => {
  this.saveData();
};
```
